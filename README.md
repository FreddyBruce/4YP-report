# 4YP-report: Dynamic Analysis of Social Networks

This contains the final report of my masters project at Oxford University. A copy of the report can be found [here](https://github.com/FreddyBruce/4YP-report/blob/master/4YP_FINAL.pdf)

## Abstract
Traditionally, research on network theory has focused on static data, yet most real networks are naturally dynamic. Social network analysis is becoming increasingly significant in fields including sociology and recommender systems. The present work is motivated by the Enron Corpus a large scale real email dataset, relating to the bankruptcy of Enron in 2001. Based on this dataset, we provide a collection of statistical and computational methods for modelling and exploring the social structure of directed communication networks.

This report proposes a technique for mapping the temporal data to a series of directed social networks using modularity. Given the extracted graphs, a method for obtaining the community structure from directed graphs is proposed â€” therefore detecting information flow. Finally, these methods are applied to the Enron Corpus to show how these techniques can be used to reveal the most influential nodes and to track communities through time.
